# Delayed Orbital Transports

Increases the orbital cooldown on orbital transports to 12 seconds. This means you have a 12 second window to intercept them when they arrive at a planet. The purpose of this is to make it harder for players to engage in Commander hopping to artificially extend the game and avoid a loss.
